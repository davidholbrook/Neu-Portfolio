# But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.

Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.

Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Thank you, steal again. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.

## Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.

Jesus must be spinning in his grave! "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.

1. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!
2. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.
3. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.

### He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?!

Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.

* Jesus must be spinning in his grave!
* You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.
* I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.

Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."

Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!

Please do not offer my god a peanut. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.

Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"

Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? I didn't get rich by signing checks. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.

Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing? Thank you, steal again. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!

And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! You don't win friends with salad. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!

I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Human contact: the final frontier. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.

Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." You don't win friends with salad. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."

Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.

I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.
